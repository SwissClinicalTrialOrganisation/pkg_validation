    "text": "Metric explanation - glossary\nThe following metrics are considered when assessing a package. These are listed in Appendix-1 below. Here we provide a precise definition:\n\nPackage name, version, release date\nversion and release date of the specific version assessed at this moment. These are required for identifying the package and for documentation. Packages will be re-assessed upon update and version changes; documentation of older versions remains in the document. These values are not included in the risk calculation.\n\n\nPurpose (statistical_package):\nWe define three risk levels for a package, depending on the package’s purpose and methodology:\n\n“non-statistical” packages: packages that deal only with data-wrangling and manipulation (e.g., dplyr) or with reporting processes (e.g., Sweave, xtable). Such processes are of ‘low risk’ as no statistical calculations are performed, and data-errors are, comparatively, easy to detect. Similarly, packages associated with application interfaces such as Shiny application are considered “non-statistical”.\n“Statistical with published methods”: packages that perform statistical calculations based on known methods, or on methods that have been published in peer reviewed journals. These packages obtain a “medium risk” status.\n“Statistical non-published methods”: packages that perform statistical calculations, but the underlying methods have not been published in a peer reviewed journal. These packages obtain a status “high risk”.\n\n\n\nAuthor (author):\nThe author(s) of a package will be viewed as indicator for its trustworthiness. If package authors (noted as ‘aut’ in the package description, e.g., as listed on CRAN) are well-known within the statistical, data-science and R communities and have credentials based on their qualifications, education, present and past affiliations, the risk of the respective package will be scored as low. If package authors have credentials based on their qualifications, education, present and past affiliations, but are not well-known within the statistical, data-science and R communities, the risk of the respective package will be scored as medium.  If package authors are not well-known within the statistical, data-science and R communities and have no clear credentials based on their qualifications, education, present and past affiliations, the risk of the respective package will be scored as high.\nNote that whether an author is ‘well-known’ in the community is a subjective assessment and accepted as such; in addition, groups of authors are evaluated as a collective.\n\n\nMaintainer (maintainer) :\nThe package has a named maintainer who’s contact details (email) are available and published. A positive answer provides a “low risk” score. A package with no named maintainer is scored as high. The rationale behind this metric lies in the fact that the indication of name and email is evidence of a package’s active maintenance and availability of contact in case of bugs and/or suggestions.\n\n\nNumber of dependencies (nr_dependencies):\nThis metric assesses the level of risk associated with the number of dependencies a package relies on. Dependencies are other packages or processes that the evaluated package depends on, as listed in CRAN under “depends” and/or “imports”. The risk of unexpected behaviour increases with the number of dependencies, since there is a greater likelihood of issues on a specific routine if updates are performed on a dependent package. Great care should be considered while using packages involving many dependencies.\nThe listed number is converted into a [0, 1] score, with 0 representing low number of dependencies (= low risk) and 1 representing many dependencies (= high risk). Taking a similar approach for the transforming the number to a score as the ‘riskmetric’ package (R validation hub, 2023), we use a simplification of the classic logistic curve as a scoring function. A sigmoid midpoint is 4 reverse dependencies, ie., x[0] = 4 and logistic growth rate of k = 0.5.\n\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nETC.",

Additional notes on the risk metrics can be found on the Risk metrics page.\n\nNote that the R package validation contains various useful functions to help with the validation process. Especially useful are:\n\nget_n_deps, which returns the number of dependencies of a package,\nget_12month_downloads which returns the number of downloads of a package in the last 12 months, and\nget_release_date finds the release date of a package.\n\n\nOnce you have completed the form, click the green “Submit new issue” button at the bottom of the page.\nSubmitting the form will trigger an automated job that will calculate the risk based on the information you entered into the form and post a comment on the issue.",
